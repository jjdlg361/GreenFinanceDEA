First, use DEAP and the data in data/processed/DEA to compute the overall technical efficiency (DEA) and perform the Malmquist index analysis. 
After obtaining the efficiency results, combine them with the data in data/processed/Tobit regression, use scripts/VIF to conduct the collinearity (VIF) diagnostic, and use scripts/Tobit to run the Tobit regression analysis. 
Finally, use the data in data/processed/Robustness checks together with scripts/Robustness Checks to perform the robustness checks.
